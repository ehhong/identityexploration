### hi, welcome!
This is a personal project on identity in Asian American communities at Harvard. Over the fall of 2018, I conducted interviews of 15 individuals from the Harvard Asian American community. Since then, I’ve compiled and illustrated their stories to convey how they see themselves to you.
<p></p>
For too long, Asian Americans have been told that their stories don’t matter. This is a small attempt to change that narrative.

### where did this come from?
This project was born out of an amalgamation of thoughts, events, and feelings. Thoughts sparked by a class on Chinese Immigration in America, working at an after school program in Chinatown, dining hall discussions, reflections on my childhood. Events: the SFFA’s lawsuit against Affirmative Action, the release of Crazy Rich Asians, the movement to disaggregate statistics describing Asian American populations. Feelings: frustration, confusion, reconciliation, love, belonging.
<p></p>
It’s easy to say that the Asian American community is as complex and heterogeneous as any other group of human beings. But unless you speak with those in the community and listen to what they have to say, it’s difficult to believe it, to deeply know that truth.
<p></p>
I’ve spent the last year or so learning a lot more about Asian American history and identity. Race is just one descriptor of a person, but in the history of the United States, it has largely proven itself definitive. There are plenty of theories, statistics, policies, etc. that seek to explain it, but I always return to the same conclusion: race is visual. It’s obvious.
<p></p>
This project is built upon that simple idea. *What would it be like to hear about how people see themselves before seeing them? What if we had more to extrapolate upon than someone’s name and profile picture?*
<p></p>
In early November 2018, with the help and support of some amazing peers and mentors, I designed this project. Then, I sent out an email to some Asian American organizations on campus asking for interviewees, and I was pleasantly surprised by the willingness and enthusiasm of those who reached out to share their stories.
<p></p>
Since then, I’ve conducted, transcribed, and illustrated fifteen 15-minute interviews. These fifteen individuals have been both brave and kind enough to share pieces of themselves with you, and I hope that through these stories, we’ll strive to listen to each other a little bit more.

### note
These interviews reflect a subset of individuals in a particular moment of time. They are not meant to make a larger statement about the Asian American community and/or identity.
<p></p>
Publicly sharing personal experiences and beliefs is an incredibly courageous act: one that requires both guts and privilege. Our identities and beliefs are constantly growing and evolving, and everybody deserves to be treated with respect. As you read, please remember that the collection presented here is not complete.

### thank u thank u thank u
Especially to the [EDU T550 @ HGSE](https://twitter.com/tfivefifty?lang=en){:.link} for fostering learning experiences that create community, fulfillment, and growth. And thank you to the interviewees who have been so open, enthusiastic, and gracious throughout the way – I hope you like it!
