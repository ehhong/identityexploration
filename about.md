Out of the many assignments in my schooling career, there are very few projects that I am truly proud of. I know this project is one of them.
<br>
It all starts with agency. I’m so accustomed to rigid structure that it took me a while to snap out of incredulity phase. Even after I processed the existence of infinite project possibilities, I still felt paralyzed. The stakes felt too high; I had no one but myself to blame for mediocrity and so choosing anything was a risk. But that also meant that when I did choose something, I poured my whole being into it.
<br>
Next step: learning communities. I’ve never been one to share my work with even my closest friends. But in T550, to share or not to share is not a debatable question. At first, in class, I was uncomfortable. I wished I could leave my work on a table and escape, leaving its creator anonymous and running from the inevitable realization of its stupidity (hello, week 1). Because I had complete control over my final project ideas, by sharing them, I felt as though I was putting myself on the line. But at some point, I realized that by staying within my own head, I was running in circles. From starting with a wishy washy identity project (somehow) involving mirrors, it took one call with Paulina (my TF) to carve out a project path and get moving again. As I continued to share ideas in class in our critique groups and more, my peers sent me resources they thought would be helpful, offered their insights, but most importantly, provided their support. Without this support, my project would have never materialized.
<br>
Inspired by a recent NYT op-ed titled “Harvard and the Myth of the Interchangeable Asian” and current events, my project is a collection of interviews on personal identity to better understand and share who the Asian American (AA) community is at Harvard. Even though I hope to use this project to explore ideas beyond myself, ultimately, this project is a piece of me. I’m a Chinese American who grew up in a predominantly white suburb. I’m a public school student who came into Harvard without a clue of just how different others’ upbringings could be. I’m an engineer and a designer; read: someone who loves to ask questions and then find clever ways to build around them. Given the current political climate and the admissions lawsuit at Harvard that is bringing to light divisions in AA community, I hope that individual acts of courage to share pieces of identity might encourage us to see those around us with fresh eyes.
Asian American identity is often a very visual one, and so I am introducing self-presented identity through an illustration before introducing the interviewee’s face. I’ve built a website and am planning to interview nearly 20 students, most of whom I hadn’t previously met. I haven’t lost the feeling that I am teetering at the end of a beam, but I can’t help but marvel at how far out I’ve traveled. Perhaps more than the product itself, this growing process is something I’ll look back at with pride.
