### hi, welcome!
This is a personal project on identity in Asian American communities at Harvard. Over the fall of 2018, I collected interviews from 15 members of the Harvard Asian American community. Since then, I’ve compiled and illustrated their stories, in an effort to convey how they see themselves to you.
<p></p>
For too long, Asian Americans have been told that their stories don’t matter. This is a small attempt to change that narrative.

### side note...
These interviews reflect a subset of individuals in a particular moment of time. They are not meant to make a larger statement about the Asian American community and/or identity.
<p></p>
Publicly sharing personal experiences and beliefs is an incredibly courageous act: one that requires both guts and privilege. Our identities and beliefs are constantly growing and evolving, and everybody deserves to be treated with respect. As you read, please remember that the collection presented here is not complete.

### where did this come from?
This project was born out of an amalgamation of thoughts, events, and feelings. Thoughts sparked by a class on Chinese Immigration in America, dining hall discussions, reflections on my childhood. Events: the SFFA’s lawsuit against Affirmative Action, the release of Crazy Rich Asians, the movement to disaggregate statistics describing Asian American populations. Feelings: frustration, confusion, reconciliation, love, belonging.
<p></p>
It’s easy to say that the Asian American community is as complex and heterogeneous as any other group of human beings. But unless you speak with those in the community and listen to what they have to say, it’s hard to really believe it, to deeply know that truth.
<p></p>
I’ve spent the last year or so learning a lot more about Asian American history and identity. Race is just one descriptor of a person, but in the history of the United States, it has largely proven itself definitive. Look anywhere and there are plenty of theories, statistics, policies, etc. that seek to explain it, but I always seem to return to the same conclusion: race is visual. It’s obvious.
<p></p>
This project is built upon that simple idea. What would it be like to hear about how people see themselves before seeing them? What if we had more to extrapolate upon than someone’s name and profile picture? Since early November 2018, I’ve conducted, transcribed, and illustrated fifteen 15-minute interviews to emulate that experience. These fifteen individuals have been both brave and kind enough to share pieces of themselves with you, and I hope that through these stories, we’ll strive to listen to each other a little bit more.

### thank u thank u thank u
Especially to the [EDU T550 @ HGSE](https://twitter.com/tfivefifty?lang=en){:.link} for fostering learning experiences that create community, fulfillment, and growth. And thank you to the interviewees who have been so open, enthusiastic, and gracious throughout the way – I hope you like it!
