<h3>What parts of your identity do you feel were important to you growing up, and have any of those aspects changed?</h3>
<p>
The first thing that comes to mind is golf. It’s a pretty big part of my identity because it's where I really spend a lot of my time and my mental energy on. I started golf really early, pretty much from when I was seven all the way up until now.
<p></p>
When I was younger, before I came to college, I used to keep golf and the rest of my life pretty separate, even though it took up so much of my time. Yet, now that I'm in college, it's more deeply ingrained in my identity, even though I'm also exploring interests outside of golf. Playing as part of a team representing a school is something that I am super proud of. There are so many connections between golf and the rest of my life now – my team is basically a second family.
<p></p>
I guess also just being Chinese, Asian. Being from Northern California and a high school that was probably about 80% Asian, it never really stood out to me that I was Asian just because everyone else was. But that changed a lot when I came to college and I think it really made me realize like wow, there's so much I can learn. I definitely felt like back home was a bit of a bubble, and I'm really glad that now I'm in a completely new place with a completely new environment and being challenged in a lot of ways I wasn't before.
<p></p>
I've also really come to realize how important friendships are, especially in a place where it's not easy to do certain things. Navigating classes, extracurriculars, the social scene [at Harvard]... Yes, you could do it alone but you really get so much more out of it when you do it with other people, and I think I've come to realize that a lot more.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use about your racial and ethnic identity, and how do some of those words connect with ways that you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>
Well, Chinese. That's for me what first comes to mind when you say identity. I am Chinese, even though I may not be Chinese in the most literal sense of the word.
<p></p>
I feel like I'm in the middle of like "American American" – whatever that means – and "Chinese Chinese" – whatever that means. My parents speak Chinese at home and there's very much a Chinese aspect in my life. I eat Chinese dishes, we go to Chinese restaurants, and we celebrate Chinese holidays. Yet, there is very much an American aspect of my life where… when I go back to China, it's hard. This summer, I interned in China for two months and lived alone, so it was really a rollercoaster. One of my coworkers just straight up asked me if I was an ABC (American Born Chinese), and it made me realize… well, I'm not like these people. It's harder for me to speak Chinese to my relatives, it's harder for me to understand what's going on in China, and it's hard for me to understand the way of life in China.
<p></p>
But I learned so much from [interning in China]. And what's funny is, if you'd asked me a year or so ago if I'd wanted to go to China to live by myself for two months, I for sure would've said no. I hated Chinese school in the past. But literally on a whim, I went to China for two months and I feel like I'm just so more appreciative of this side of me, and now I'm taking Chinese and it's awesome.
</p>

<h3>How do you think others see you?</h3>
<p>
Because I was from a place where most of my friends were Asian, once I got to the east coast I kind of was like, I want to branch out and meet different kinds of people. And so I got out of my comfort zone to meet a lot of different kinds of people, which I learned a lot from. Doing this highlighted that I wasn't exactly like other people in certain ways. Perspectives-wise, looks-wise, backgrounds-wise… there were a lot of differences. Yet one thing I noticed is that most of the people I met still treated me the same and they were really interested in, I guess, my background... they were very receptive. That's something that I've come to realize now, some of my closest friends at Harvard are in fact not Asian, but this in no way takes away from my identity of being Asian. In general, I've come to really appreciate this kind of diversity of people in my life now. At the end of the day, these people are my friends and they view me in the same way, even if my background is different. It's a really good learning experience.
</p>

<h3>Would you want others to see you differently?</h3>
<p>
Personally, I'm someone that doesn't want to care about what other people think of me but does care [laughs].
<p></p>
Obviously everyone's a little bit insecure about how people see them and I think in the past, I probably wanted to be different. But right now – obviously there are some things I'd like to change about myself – I think I'm coming to the realization that it's really just cool to be who you are. I'm an ABC, I was born in America, but I'm Chinese. I play a sport at Harvard, which is something I don't even believe sometimes. I go to Harvard. That's also something that's insane. And I think I'm trying to kind of accept the different quirks that come with my personality and who I am. It’s a work in progress.
