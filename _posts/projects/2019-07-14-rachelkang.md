<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
The first thing that comes to mind, as a really important part of my identity, is being a woman! It affects every single aspect of my life, and I've been learning more and more these days about how it affects my life even in ways I hadn't noticed before.
<br>
Another important part of how I identify myself is as an Asian American, specifically Korean American. Interestingly, I don't remember thinking as much about my Asian American identity before coming to college, even though I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood.
<br>
Last but not least, I see myself as an older sister. I have a younger sister who's nine years younger than me and that's always been a huge part of my life – mostly because she's my only sibling and because the age gap is so large.
</p>

<h3>What parts of your identity were most important to you growing up?</h3>
<p>
I guess this is where my sister comes more into play. Growing up, I was very lonely at first.  For one, it wasn't until I was nine that my sister came into my life, and elementary school kids always talk about their brothers and sisters! Also, as my parents were really strict, which is also largely associated with the Asian American part of my identity, I didn't hang out with people that much outside of school. So, I think the absence of a sibling in my life played a huge factor in my growing-up.
But once I found out that my sister was coming into my life, I was super excited and spent a huge chunk of my time preparing for her arrival. Once she actually came into my life, it was a complete game-changer!
</p>

<h3>What are some similarities or differences between how you saw yourself growing up versus now?</h3>
<p>
I find myself reflecting more about how and why things are the way they are.
<br>
To give you a brief overview of my development as an Asian American: I started off at a school where I was basically the only Asian kid. Then I moved in second grade to a still predominantly white school, but with a small Asian American population. That was the first time I saw other Asian kids, but I was actually bullied by them because I was "that new kid."  In middle school, I met many more Asians and finally made Asian friends, my former "frenemies" becoming friends too. And then in high school, all of my friends were Asian.
<br>
Growing up, I never really thought about why I came to have more and more Asian friends and why I was interacting less and less with white people. I think I just accepted things with a "this is just how it is" type of mentality. But now that I'm in college and have learned from more people and through more experiences, I've become a lot more aware of why such patterns exist.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial or ethnic identity and how do some of those words connect to ways that you do or don't see yourself?</h3>
<p>
So I describe it as Asian American and Korean American, depending on the context.
<br>
Actually, growing up, I made a pretty big distinction between Korean and other Asian Americans, mostly because the most prominent racist remark I always fell victim to was the assumption that I was Chinese. To clarify, I didn't have anything against Chinese people – it just really bothered me that a lot of people didn't know what "Korean" even was, and that people just labelled me as they saw fit.
<br>
Over and over, people would look at me and say “OMG, small eyes” and “OMG, you're Chinese.” And I would always defensively flail, "No, I'm not!"
<br>
In fact, I remember coming home crying one day because another kid had told me that although I had eyes, I didn't have eyeballs – in retrospect, it was definitely a racist remark that also made zero sense, but I had no idea back then.
<br>
It took me a while to realize that all Asian Americans face similar struggles, despite the unique struggles of each specific ethnicity.  But now that I know this, "Asian American" has definitely become a lot more salient to me as well.
</p>

<h3>How do you feel about how you are seen by others? Um, and would you want others to see you differently?</h3>
<p>
Okay – I appreciate you asking this the way you've worded the question because in all honesty, even with how I answered your previous questions, whenever people speak of identity, I don't really think about my self. I always think, "what categories do I fall into?" I describe how I identify myself in terms of the categories that others might ascribe me to, but these categories are so far from being all-encompassing.
<br>
Although these categories come to mind in conversations like this, I don't actively think, "oh, I am a Korean American, Asian American woman with a younger sister, nine years younger than me." That's just one way I present myself in-line with society's obsession of labelling everyone and everything. It's not how I go about my life. All these categories intersect so much, and to form just a part of who I am, but no category perfectly captures exactly who I am. And that goes for everyone!
So I guess I don't want people to see me as a being that fits into these categories, even though I identified myself in that manner too. I want people to see me for who I am, beyond these labels – to see me for what I like to do, the conversations I share with them, the way I treat others, and all the subtle things that don't have labels.
