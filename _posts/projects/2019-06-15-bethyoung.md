<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
Racial identity has definitely become more prominent for me. Growing up, I lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. It was maybe 80% white, 20% Asian, and literally nothing else. So, it was not super diverse. College was kind of a culture shock to see people from all different backgrounds. Harvard is one of the most diverse places that I've been in, and I really appreciate that about the school.
<br>
It’s not as prominent, but I identify as a woman of color. There are a lot of layers tied to that because I feel like as an Asian American, you are not given as much like clout as a person of color because you get many benefits that other races don't get. As a woman, it's like, oh, I have two minority issues going for me, but sometimes it's hard to understand if my feelings are justified when there are other people who don't benefit as much.
<br>
Being a student is a big part of my identity as I'm looking towards graduation. I’ve been a student for 16 years, and it’s hard to know what life is like outside of school. That’s something I'm sure is going to change, but I think I'll always be a student because I just love learning.
<br>
I also identify as just a caring person who wants to make people feel included. Part of the reason why I joined HoCo is because it didn't feel like I really felt I could belong in any place at Harvard, and I really struggled with that sophomore year. Through HoCo, I am an integral part of creating community for others, and it's nice to have that agency and to know that in some ways hopefully, I can make people feel more welcome here.
</p>

<h3>How have that compare to how you see yourself now?</h3>
<p>
I think since growing up people are just more comfortable with the other gender, you kind of mature a little bit.
I've also become more cognizant of my racial identity – what it means to be Asian American, what it means to like have immigrant parents. I feel like there's a lot of indirect pressure to be successful or to make a good life here because your family came here for that opportunity. I think that definitely shapes the type of person you are.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial or ethnic identity, and how do some of those words connect with ways that you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>
I describe myself as Asian American, Chinese American.
<br>
In my Asian American Literature class, we've talked about how there's a difference between the hyphenated Asian-American versus the non-hyphenated Asian American. I didn't even know it was a thing, I just assumed there's a hyphen grammar wise. But there's something about having the hyphen there, as if you're not American enough by just being. You're Asian-American – you're describing the Americanness. Without the hyphen, it’s is a validated identity; you can do both without being a type of American.
<br>
When people think of Asian American, people think model minority, high socioeconomic status, and well educated, which is a stereotype. For me, my grandmother never went to high school, and both of my parents were lucky enough to have college educations, but when they came to America they both had to re-go to school because they couldn't practice what they were doing in China in America. I'll never truly understand what that felt like, and they've done a good job of minimizing it. But things come up and that's really tough, you know? I don't know if people realize that. It's not necessarily that I don't want it to be shared, but it's just weird to put all of that information on someone who you're just meeting. You don't want to overwhelm people by being like, well actually, all this stuff happened, but it's all there.
</p>

<h3>How do you think that others see you?</h3>
<p>
I think other people see me as extroverted, outgoing, caring. I think I'm generally a pretty bubbly, happy-go-lucky kind of person. Naturally, I'm pretty happy most of the time, but sometimes it's hard to keep it up. Some days I'm just don't want to speak to anybody, but there's definitely a pressure to kind of fulfill that persona.
</p>

<h3>How do you feel about how you’re seen by others, and would you want others to see you differently?</h3>
<p>
I feel like I'm pretty comfortable with how other people see me only because I'm a very open book. If you talk to me, I'm just going to like tell you how I feel and put all my cards out because I feel like I truly have nothing to hide. Whatever impression people have of me, I think I'm okay with it because I would just put everything out there. I'm probably really annoying and I talk too much. But I think that people, if they interact with me, they know who I am, and I think I'm happy about that.
