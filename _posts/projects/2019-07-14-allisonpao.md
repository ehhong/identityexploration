<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
A huge part of my identity is music. I've played violin since I was five and trombone and other instruments as well as I got older, and I’ve always identified as both a band kid and orchestra kid. I’ve been playing music all my life, and everyone always knew me at my international school as "the violinist," so when I got to Harvard, it was really natural for me to start playing in the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra and Brattle Street Chamber Players. But at the beginning of this year, I wanted to try a lot of new things and I realized, okay, I can't really do all these things if I'm also doing all this music stuff. Having to make those decisions was harder than I thought because when I stopped playing violin on a weekly basis, it definitely felt like losing a part of myself.
<p></p>
Another part of my identity… Whenever people ask, what do you want to do when you grow up, I never really had one particular dream job. But my answer was always, oh, I just want to make a positive difference. And people were like, okay, that's not really specific. But I felt like my identity was… what was more important to me was the value and the purpose of what I was doing and not necessarily the job itself.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial/ethnic identity, and how do those words connect with how you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>
I guess I identify as a Chinese American, but that's something I rejected a lot of times.
<p></p>
I didn't like being Chinese American because I used to get comments. I remember in middle school I would bring my Rubik's cube to class and then someone asked me, "Oh, do your parents force you to do that?" And then another person asked me like, "do your parents beat you at home?" I remember telling my mom in middle school, I wish I weren't Asian, and I wish I were white or black or something else.
<p></p>
All these parts of [being Chinese American] I didn't really consider until I took a step back and either went elsewhere or went into a new community. The American part of my identity I didn't really recognize until I moved to Switzerland. When I got to Switzerland, people would have these views about America, and because I would often be the sole representative of America in my high school, I always felt the need to like defend my homeland [laughs].
<p></p>
I don't think it was really until this summer that I actually started to identify myself strongly as a Chinese American because I spent the summer in Shanghai. Being there for the first time in over 10 years, I finally realized, wow, this is something that I actually do care about.
<p></p>
Going to China, there was a weird dissonance between looking Chinese, but as soon as I opened my mouth, people would know [I’m Chinese American] because I have an American accent and my Chinese is not that great. I remember sitting in a taxi ride with a white coworker who spoke better Chinese than I did at the time, and somehow the taxi driver started ranting about Chinese American immigrants who can't even speak their own language and don't even know their own homeland. The taxi driver probably assumed that I didn't understand any Chinese, but I just started listening and… It's so hard because… I mean he's right and he's wrong. At some point, what right do you have to tell someone else what their identity is? I grew up in America. I spent my life learning American values and I know so much about US history and Swiss history cause that's where I live. Just because I don't know about Chinese history doesn't mean that I'm a bad person or an ignorant person or that I don't care.

<h3>How do you think others see you?</h3>
<p>
It's hard to say, it's kind of like the chicken and egg problem. I don't know whether the things I chose to do were because I didn't want to be perceived as Asian, or if I chose activities and then I realized that they didn't conform to the Asian stereotype. I just remember decisions like choosing to do MUN over Science Olympiad, or choosing band over orchestra. Just these little decisions that I'm not sure if they were motivated unconsciously by my desire not to be perceived in a certain way. I guess I always wanted to be different or unique, but I felt like I couldn't because of the way I looked. Which sounds really strange because I mean to a certain point, everyone looks the same. Just because I'm Asian doesn't mean I have less of an ability to look different, but for some reason that's what it felt like.
</p>

<h3>How do you feel about how you are seen by others, and would you want others to see you differently?</h3>
<p>
It's like that thought experiment. If nobody knew you were a violinist and you never played your violin in front of anyone else, would you still be a violinist? I feel like the answer to that is yes and no. It's not that I would want people to see me differently in that I wouldn't want to try to twist things to make people have a certain perception of my identity. But at the same time, parts of my identity, I would want them to be known. For example, when I talked about my identity as wanting to make a positive impact on people, the very essence of that requires me to do things in relation to other people. So in that sense, I would want to affect how people perceive me through my actions. But in the other sense, I wouldn't want to make that a manufactured identity.
