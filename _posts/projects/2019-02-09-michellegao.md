<h3>What parts of your identity do you feel that you interact with most on a daily basis?</h3>
<p>
I think now, race has played a bigger part of my identity the more I've grown up, especially here at Harvard because of the lawsuit. I also think because, you know, like race and gender are the two things that you can really see in a person. And I mean... you know, obviously with gray areas but not really for me. I think it's pretty clear [laughs].
</p>

<h3>What parts of your identity were most important to you growing up?</h3>
<p>
Yeah, I mean I guess I am also not a very imaginative person [laughs], so I feel like there have only been a couple of identities I've ever really thought about or considered strong enough to be identities.
<br>
I think... I think I'm much more interested in my Chinese identity now in terms of actually trying to learn about it. For example, I'm taking this class on Chinese government and doing other things to familiarize myself more with [China], because when I was younger, I obviously was still Chinese [laughs] and did Chinese things like food and whatnot, but I don't think I had as deep an appreciation for the actual scope of that culture outside of me and my immediate family.
</p>

<h3>Is how you see yourself now different from how you identify?</h3>
<p>
Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think for example, when I'm writing, I've written a couple of articles about race, but I've actually written very few articles specifically about Asian identity–actually probably only one. And I really didn't want to, for example, write a column that was going to be on racial issues, and I don't really want to be seen as someone who opines only on things I specifically know. I mean obviously with some exceptions, there are some topics I wouldn't write about because I think it's too important to have some personal experience. But even as an Asian person, I feel it's well within my wheelhouse to opine on racial issues in general or other political things.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial and/or ethnic identity and how do some of those words connect to ways you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>
Well, I used to think, obviously I'm Asian American, I'm Asian and I live in America. But I guess, more recently, I’ve figured that that second part is actually maybe an assumption I've been able to make in my own life. I don't know, other people... it feels like some other people have been questioning even the fact of living in America. Does that make you American? That's something perhaps I've always been fortunate enough to assume.
</p>

<h3>How do you feel that other people see you?</h3>
<p>
We've already talked about how those physical attributes are the first things people see.
I don't know. I mean there are obviously things I want to be known for outside of that. I mean, I already talked about, for example, one of the cool things about writing is that you can just sort of have your opinion stand for itself. Although, because of your byline, people can already make assumptions about who you are.
<br>
I think the assumptions people would get from my byline are correct ones–that I'm an Asian female. But yeah, I guess, you know, being known for things that you actually do as opposed to those facts.
</p>

<h3>Do you think your ethnic identity connects with the ways that others see you?</h3>
<p>
I mean, I guess so. I transitioned from public school to private school and I was 12, I think. And certainly being an Asian person here or at Harvard, I think it's just more assumed that “you earned your seat” however you got it.
<br>
I belong to a program that's mostly Black and Latino, and certainly when they were talking to us about transitioning from their own communities to schools in very different communities, I think it was always an easier transition for the Asian students, like feeling closer to whiteness I guess.
<br>
And I, I don't know, at times I've been accused of wanting to be white or you know, subscribing maybe more to the model of whiteness in the world. Maybe that's a lack of imagination. Like I can't imagine a world where white people don't control things that you'd have to do, but... I don't know… I think that is a realistic assumption to a realistic premise.
</p>

<h3>Would you want others to see you differently?</h3>
<p>
Yeah, mostly. I mean, I guess I generally advocate for less use of race in the world.
I think it's sort of counterintuitive in this age when we are trying to–at the same time be more aware of all these different identities–to sort of reinforce their differences. It’s sort of paradoxical, right? I don't really know how exactly that should work out.
<br>
I guess I've come across as saying that people do see my race, but at the same time I don't think it's a huge part of what they actually think, you know, if they're just like, "that person over there, I can remember her face" or whatever.
<br>
I guess I am trying to advocate for a world in which those things will matter less because I think they're kind of... not irrelevant, but just sort of unproductive at times.
