<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
I am a student of architecture, on my way–hopefully–to become a licensed architect. That's going to take another couple of years after school.
<br>
I have a partner in New York, I’m a brother, and I’m a son.
<br>
And I guess I've also been trying to figure out what it means to be Japanese American, My mom is Jewish, and I got to connect with that side of the family when I was living in New York. My Japanese family and my Jewish family could not be more unalike. So yeah, there's a constant struggle between those parts of my life...
</p>

<h3>Which parts of your identity are most important to you?</h3>
<p>
Architecture is the most important point. I think also, I go in and out of thinking whether my identity as a Jewish person or a Japanese person is important or not in the practice of architecture.
<br>
I think now, in school, it's sort of becoming more apparent to me that the practice of architecture is the most important thing. I've found it hard to include conversations [about being Jewish and Japanese] in what I do, or at least to also find a community around it. So I think for the most part, I've decided that architecture is the priority, and then for everything else, I want to keep up the language and the conversation around it.
<br>
And then with family, that’s actually the most important thing. Although that's a complicated issue.
</p>

<h3>What parts of your identity were most important to you growing up? I assume there was a time before architecture.</h3>
<p>
Before, before, before...
<br>
Study has always been the most important thing in my head, based on what my dad taught me; it was an almost absolute. I ignored family, ignored friends... I think as a result there was no reason to think about identity. I also grew up in Portland, it's like 90 percent white. Well, I take that back. I went to a Japanese immersion program so I know a tiny, tiny bit of Japanese. But for some reason, I think it was still hard to communicate with a lot of the kids, probably just because I was so stressed out all the time.
<br>
[Conversations around identity] didn't enter my mind until probably a couple of years after college. Up until that point, life was steady. And then I went to the architecture program, and then it was architecture, then after that it was like, oh, wow, there's the whole world [laughs].
</p>

<h3>What are some similarities and/or differences between how you saw yourself growing up versus now?</h3>
<p>
If I had to choose one right now... I used to operate out of fear, and now I operate – on a good day – out of optimism.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial and ethnic identity and how do some of those words connect to ways you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>
That's a great question.
<br>
As I'm not a part of–on a daily basis–a community of fourth generation Japanese Americans or Jews, Jewish people, or mixed Jewish Asian people, I don't know if I have a very big vocabulary of speaking about myself or issues within this sphere.
<br>
So I guess the only two words I'd say are Jewish and Japanese American... that's a great question. I think.... I think... I think most of the time I am not either. In the context of talking to certain people, I'm one or the other, but looking back, I am inevitably a result of both of those things. So that's a hard... this is why it's so hard to answer because on the one hand I'm not thinking about it, but on the other hand if I actually sat down and thought about it, it has been a big part of my life. So it's, I don't know…
</p>

<h3>Do you feel that you are seen differently than how you present yourself?</h3>
<p>
I used to feel that way. I don't know how much I feel that on a daily basis now. I actually found Portland to be a tough place, and I didn't realize that until I moved to New York. I don't know if it’s because [New York] is a more diverse city, but generally [in New York] I feel like a relationship begins with whatever question you ask, but I didn't necessarily feel that in Portland. A lot of times, I felt there was a pre-judgement about who I was, good or bad, and it's something that I have to contend with.
<br>
[At Harvard], there hasn't been an issue at all, which has been really nice. Everyone is inquisitive enough that it's not enough to just see someone and think, “I know who you are.” Everyone is really into asking questions, and I love questions.
