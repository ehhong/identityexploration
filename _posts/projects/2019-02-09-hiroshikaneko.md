<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
I am a student of architecture, on my way–hopefully – to become a licensed architect. That's going to take another couple of years after school.
I have a partner in New York, I’m a brother, and I’m a son.
<br>
And I guess I've also been trying to figure out what it means to be Japanese American, Also, my mom is Jewish, so I think when I was living in New York I got to connect a little bit with that side. My Japanese family and my Jewish family could not be more unalike. So yeah, I think there's a constant struggle between those parts of my life...
</p>

<h3>Which parts of your identity are most important to you?</h3>
<p>
I think the architecture is the most important point. I think also, I go in and out of thinking whether my identity as a Jewish person or a Japanese person is important or not in the practice of architecture.
<br>
I think now, in school, it's sort of becoming more apparent to me that the practice of architecture is maybe the most important thing. I found it hard to include conversations [about being a Jewish and Japanese] in what I do, or at least to also find a community around it. So I think for the most part, I decided that architecture is the priority, and then for everything else, I want to keep up the language and the conversation around it, but I don't know if it's as important as [architecture].
<br>
And then with family, I think that’s the most important thing. Although that's a complicated issue.
</p>

<h3>What parts of your identity were most important to you growing up? I assume there was a time before architecture.</h3>
<p>
Before, before, before...
<br>
I think study has been always the most important thing in my head, based on what my dad taught me; it was an almost absolute. I ignored family, ignored friends... I think as a result there was no reason to think about identity. I also grew up in Portland, it's like 90 percent white. Well, I take that back. I went to a Japanese immersion program so I know a tiny, tiny bit of Japanese. Um, but for some reason, I think it was still hard to communicate with a lot of the kids, probably just because I was so stressed out all the time.
<br>
I think everything didn't enter my mind until I'd say probably a couple of years after college. Up until that point, life was steady. And then I went to the architecture program, and then it was architecture, then after that it was like, oh, wow, there's the whole world [laughs].
</p>

<h3>What are some similarities and/or differences between how you saw yourself growing up versus now?</h3>
<p>
I would say if I had to choose one right now... I used to operate out of fear, and now I operate – on a good day – out of optimism.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial and ethnic identity and how do some of those words connect to ways you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>
That's a great question.
<br>
As I'm not a part of–on a daily basis–a community of fourth generation Japanese Americans and or Jews, Jewish people, or mixed Jewish Asian people, I don't know if I have a very big vocabulary of like speaking about myself or issues within that sphere.
<br>
So I guess the only two words I'd say then are Jewish and Japanese American and... that's a great question. I think.... I think... I think most of the time if I had to think consciously, I think most of the time I am not either. In the context of talking to certain people, I'm one or the other, but looking back, I am inevitably a result of both of those things. So that's like a hard... this is why it's so hard to answer because it's like on the one hand I'm not thinking about it, but on the other hand if I actually sat down and thought about it, I would think about those things. So it's like, i don't know…
</p>

<h3>Do you feel that you are seen differently than how you present yourself?</h3>
<p>
I think I used to feel that way. I don't know how much I feel that on a daily basis now. I think I actually think I found Portland to be a tough place, and I didn't realize that until I moved to New York. I don't know if it’s because [New York] is a city that is used to seeing lots of different people, but generally [in New York] I felt like the relationship begins with whatever question you ask, but I didn't necessarily feel that in Portland. A lot of times, I felt there was a pre-judgement about who I was, good or bad, but it's still something that I would have to contend with in a way.
<br>
[At Harvard], there hasn't been an issue at all, which has been really nice. Everyone is inquisitive enough that it's not enough to just see someone and think, “I know who you are.” Everyone is really into asking questions, and I love questions.
