<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
I don't really see being Asian as a large part of my identity. It's definitely a part of my identity, but it's not something that I point to as like my purpose or my sole defining feature.
<p></p>
I guess what I see is my identity is… I aspire to be as authentic as possible and as genuine as I can be when I'm interacting with people. I have largely seen myself that way instead of framing myself within a certain activity or identity group.
<p></p>
How that manifested itself actually was being in journalism in high school and having to interview people about themselves. I would be the one asking a question and then have to filter out, what's the good quote? And often, that was how authentic and raw it was. So, that was how I adopted a value system.
</p>

<h3>What parts of your identity do you feel were most important to you growing up?</h3>
<p>
Up until I was in fourth grade or so, I was fairly quiet and fairly shy, and I much more fit the stereotype of the quiet Asian girl. Then, I played volleyball and that brought me out of my shell. For a while, that was a big source of confidence – playing sports.
<p></p>
In the latter years of high school, [sports] started to become less of a part of my identity, and journalism started to play a bigger role. But I definitely credit sports for being a huge reason why I don't see myself as shy.
</p>

<h3>What are some similarities or differences between how you saw yourself growing up versus now?</h3>
<p>
I think it's more of a continuum than one dramatic shift.
<p></p>
I think that one big part of my identity is having a younger brother who is amazing at math, and that is another Asian stereotype, right? In high school, despite being two years younger than me, he was actually a level above me in math, which is crazy. I've been grateful for that because it made me realize that you can find a niche outside of the stereotype, and that even within the family, for the person who's really good at math, math is not indicative of that entire person's identity.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial/ethnic identity, and how do some of those words connect with ways that you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>
I’m Chinese American, my parents both moved here – my mom to the States and my dad to Canada – when they were very young. So I've essentially been second generation. But I still do consider myself Chinese American, and I think that part of my identity has always been very affirmed because I've grown up in the Bay Area in schools that were so heavily Asian. My high school I would approximate is around 40% East Asian and 40% South Asian. I've never felt like I had to distance myself from [being Asian]. If anything, I was almost less Asian than my peers because my parents had lived [in the United States] for so long.
<p></p>
I would characterize this by what my family eats for dinner typically. We just have everything with the rice, and that I think is a good metaphor for my identity – “just with rice.” If we have ribs for example, something stereotypically very American, we'll still have rice with it. Or after Thanksgiving, we'll have congee with Turkey. It's sort of the cursory Asian-ness there, but stripped of a lot of things that other people have experienced growing up with parents who have more recently immigrated.
</p>

<h3>How do you feel that others see you?</h3>
<p>
I feel like other people see me as fairly willing to do my own thing, as in if someone says something that I don't agree with, I will be fairly direct about like expressing my opinion, whether that's agreeing or disagreeing.
<p></p>
In terms of Asian-ness, multiple people have called me a fake Asian because I don't speak Chinese. I don't like sushi because seaweed is gross to me [laughs]. I didn't grow up with certain tropes of the Asian childhood, and while I find some parts of the meme page, Subtle Asian Traits, immensely relatable, I can't even understand other parts of it because I don't speak Chinese, and that's kind of sad to me. I guess I'm not subtly Asian enough [laughs], but it's fine. It's always just a joke. I haven't really taken anything too seriously or had some sort of crisis of identity because I'm not Asian enough.
</p>

<h3>How do you feel about how you’re seen by others, and would you want others to see you differently?</h3>
<p>
I feel good about it, and so far I wouldn't change that much. I would be upset if I thought I was getting pigeonholed, but just because I've been lucky with where I grew up and who I've been surrounded with, I haven't found that to be the case. But so far with the Bay Area, good Asian food, lots of Asian people. I don't think people generally hold stereotypes just because they know so many Asian people.
<p></p>
Constance Wu once said in an interview that she knows that there will be real progress in Hollywood when you can create a show about an Asian nerd that totally fits the stereotype, and he or she gets his or her own story. So far, Hollywood has been trying to explicitly show characters to counteract the stereotypes, but you know that real progress has been achieved when they can create a character who embodies that stereotype in every way and make them the focus.
