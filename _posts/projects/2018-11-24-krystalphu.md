<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>I would identify myself as an Asian American.
<br>
In terms of gender identity, I struggled with what femininity meant to me for a while until I discovered the concept of women of color, which comes from a lot of black feminists who were trying to grapple with the fact that, you know, traditional white feminism didn't really work the same ways for non-white women. And I think that understanding the theories behind feminism–and black feminism and in particular–helped me feel more comfortable with my gender as a woman.
<br>
I'm also bisexual. I'm kind of newly out. I was sort of out to close friends and a few of my family members before, and then this year I just decided, hey, people have been supportive of me so far in college, and it just felt like something I didn't really want to conceal anymore about myself. Growing up when I was confused about my sexuality, it would have been nice to have a role model to look up to and to know that eventually, as a queer person, you won't be as confused or scared as you were as a high schooler – I wanted to be that role model for other people. Also, I was reading a cinematography article on the BBC that was talking about the phenomenon of "bisexual lighting," which is the pink, purple, and blue, and it's pretty commonly used for bisexual characters in neon-lit club scenes in movies and TV shows, which I thought was really interesting! Janelle Monae also uses that lighting pattern a lot in her music videos, and I'm a big fan of hers. So I was like, you know, as a photographer, what better way would there be to come out other than to take a self-portrait with bisexual lighting? So I tried that and it was like, yeah, I think I want to do this.

<h3>What parts of your identity are most important to you?</h3>
<p>I think definitely my identity as a woman of color. I lived in a fairly white town for most of my life. Even though it was quite progressive and people were generally accepting of race, there were instances when I was growing up when kids would be really mean about it, or even teachers would sometimes be very ignorant about racial tensions or saying things that were not okay in the classroom. So I felt… I mean, for one, I was grappling with the fact that I had feelings for women, and then also grappling with the fact that I didn't feel like I fit in the mold of femininity or whiteness that was given to me in the context that I grew up in.
<br>
So discovering my identity as a woman of color... it felt like a haven, just to be able to feel as if there were other people who had that experience and who I could talk to about it and feel valid.

<h3>How do you describe your racial and ethnic identity, and how does that affect how you do or don’t see yourself?</h3>
<p>My racial identity is Asian American.
<br>
My ethnic identity is a little more complicated. My family is majority Chinese ethnically speaking, but both sides of my family are from Vietnam, and on my father's side we are partially Vietnamese. So that has made it difficult to fit in with the Chinese American community, especially with older members of the Chinese American community. I think there are a lot of sort of expectations about retainment of culture in the Chinese American community that I don't quite meet. I don't speak Mandarin fluently, and I can only read a little bit of Chinese. I tend to feel a little more aligned culturally with the Vietnamese American community – in my experience, Vietnamese Americans tend to be very accepting, and our culture is really very underappreciated.
</p>

<h3>How do you think that others see you?</h3>
<p>At first, a lot of people have the impression that I'm quieter and a little more meek than I actually am. As soon as anyone gets to know me even a little bit, they'd see that I'm kind of a loud person. I'm really not afraid to tell people things they don't want to hear, if that's what I believe is right. I think my parents raised me to be that way because they were afraid people would stereotype me or take advantage of me in social and professional situations. And I think, you know, from that first impression a lot of people will think, oh, she's probably shy, or strait-laced, or whatever the words are that sort of characterize me as someone I'm not. I enjoy – almost a little too much – bucking that initial impression that people have of me. For example, I choose particular ways of dressing that go along with that. I guess, if I wear heels all the time it's because I enjoy announcing my presence when I walk into a room. It's probably off-putting, but I do it anyway. I like feeling that type of self-confidence. I worked hard for it.</p>
