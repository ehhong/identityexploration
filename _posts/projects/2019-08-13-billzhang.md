<h3>What are some ways that you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
Something that I've been recognizing as more and more prevalent over time is I see myself as a bridge between America and China. Mainly because when I was a kid, there was always this binary where when you leave the house, you speak English to people, you have a certain way you act, but the way you are inside the house is completely different. Outside the house is a lot more curious, a lot more adventurous, and a lot more outgoing. But inside the house it had to be very obedient and responsible, responsible and careful. They developed into two different personalities, and going through middle school and high school, it was kind of hard for me to understand why these two existed and why they weren't the same.
</p><p>
Coming into college I realized that these two identities kind of came from two different cultural backgrounds, two different ways, two different upbringings. And I think they both have a lot of merits, right? Hopefully, I will recognize more and more of their shortcomings and use each other to compensate. But I see myself still coexisting between these two identities. Hopefully, one day I can use my identity and my experiences to help better facilitate cultural exchanges and dialogue between the two cultures and the two countries.
</p>

<h3>What parts of your identity are most important to you?</h3>
<p>
I would say my personality mainly because I think that defines who I am, and that's something that I have control to an extent, right? There's always a tug of war going on in me between different parts of my personality or different manifestations of it, like different impulses or emotions. I think it's really nice to be able to turn [my personality] on and off with different people to see it change over time, hopefully see it get better over time.
</p>

<h3>What parts of your identity were most important to you growing up?</h3>
<p>
There are only very few instances in my life where what I thought was most important was not my personality. Probably only a couple of times at the beginning of elementary school, where I felt like being Asian was weird, mainly because of bringing lunch to school and some manifestation of bullying. My parents played a very, very important role in helping me overcome that.
In general, throughout my life, personality has always been most important to me. I think the main reason why race or gender hasn't really been that much of an issue is because I never really felt like a minority as an Asian American. My elementary school and middle school and high school were all very much almost Asian majority, and that meant that there was never a sense of "I needed to fit in with the culture that didn't make sense to me." And I didn't even realize that there was this very big issue of whitewashing or Asians not being able to embrace their culture until I got to college and heard other people's stories about how their identities shaped them or how they tried to push away their identity.
</p>

<h3>What words do you use to describe your racial/ethnic identity, and how do some of those words connect with how you see yourself?</h3>
<p>
Chinese American.
</p><p>
Something that I've actually noticed very recently is the fact that media in the past few decades is been very white. And that's something that I didn't really realize growing up.
</p><p>
I saw this [issue of representation] manifest in myself when I started watching more Chinese films and Chinese TV shows and listening to Chinese songs, that there was some sort of connection there that I didn't find in Western media. Now, I can more clearly see how my race has impacted how I experienced certain things. It has broadened my viewpoint, allowed me to distinguish between the two cultures and see things from a different point of view.
</p>

<h3>How do you think others see you?</h3>
<p>
That's a good question. I worry about that. I can never find answers to that.
</p><p>
I'll be completely honest, I try to pay a lot of attention to how other people see me and I try my best to present a good image of myself. But in the end, I have no idea how people see me, and so I can only speculate.
</p>

<h3>How do you think your racial/ethnic identity connects with ways that others see you?</h3>
<p>
Inevitably, the fact that I'm Chinese jumps out first when someone sees me. And same with when I see other people too.
I guess that shapes how people see me, but otherwise I don't think that my race really plays a big part, in how I see other people at least. I don't know how other people see me, maybe they put different traits or labels on me because they see that I'm Chinese, but I don't really know what that would look like.
</p>

<h3>Would you want others to see you differently?</h3>
<p>
I'm pretty satisfied. Anything that I want to change about how others see in me, I can change myself, so I don't really want to just wish that something would change. Maybe this is me just saying things from very sheltered perspective where I have control over everything. But in reality, there are a lot of things you can't control. Maybe I just don't realize a lot of those factors yet or haven’t seen their impact on my life, but at the present moment, I would say that I'm pretty satisfied.
